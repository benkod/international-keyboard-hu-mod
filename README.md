# Hungarian Modified US International Keyboard Layout

This repository contains a custom modification of the US International keyboard layout designed to facilitate the input of Hungarian specific characters. This mod allows users to type the Hungarian letters `ő` and `ű` using a combination of the caret (`^`) key and the letters `o` and `u`.
